### Post 1: Problem Awareness (Emotional Hook)
**"The moment my mom looked at me and said 'Do I know you?' broke my heart."**

Every 65 seconds, someone in America develops Alzheimer's disease. For families like mine, watching a loved one slip away is devastating.

But what if there was a way to help them hold onto their memories longer? What if technology could give us more quality time together?

Our AI companion has helped 500+ families extend meaningful conversations and connection by an average of 18 months. The invisible cognitive training works through natural daily conversations - patients don't even realize they're receiving therapy.
